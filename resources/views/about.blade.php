            <h2 class="md:text-4xl text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Founding Date and Brief History</h2>
            <p><strong>Incepted in 2019</strong>, the Rotaract Club of APIIT was chartered through the pioneering vision and efforts of our inaugural president, <strong>Rtr. PP. Vinura Weerakoon</strong>, and the dedicated support of our Club Patron, <strong>Mr. Vihanga Jayasinghe</strong>. Despite starting with a modest membership base of just <strong>18 members</strong>, the club has rapidly evolved over the past six years into a vibrant, youth-led organization with nearly <strong>100 committed members</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>In the early years, <strong>RAC APIIT</strong> encountered numerous challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and faced financial constraints as a self-funded club. However, our determination never faltered. Thanks to the relentless efforts of the <strong>5 past Presidents</strong> and their teams, RAC APIIT has not only survived but thrived, achieving consistent growth and reaching new heights.</p>
            
            <p>During the <strong>RI years 2023/24</strong>, under the transformative leadership of <strong>Rtr. IPP. Janani Mathiyalagan</strong>, RAC APIIT experienced unprecedented growth. This era was marked by the introduction of several signature projects, including <strong>‘Baila Friday’</strong>, <strong>‘Frosts of Love’</strong>, and <strong>‘Thaiththirunaal’</strong>, all of which have gained significant attention and acclaim. For the first time, we also received prestigious awards and accolades at the <strong>34th Rotaract District Assembly</strong> and expanded our influence on a global scale, further solidifying our reputation.</p>
            
            <p>As we continue to climb the ladder of excellence, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the core values of Rotaract: <strong>service, leadership, and fellowship</strong>. Over the years, <strong>RAC APIIT</strong> has become a beacon of unity, resilience, and the indomitable spirit of our members. As we embark on our 6th year, we are driven by the mission to <strong>serve beyond boundaries</strong>, always remembering that <strong>today’s youth is tomorrow’s future</strong>.</p>

              <p>Now, in our <strong>6th successful year</strong>, under the visionary leadership of <strong>Rtr. Shagaan Thevarajah</strong>, the Rotaract Club of APIIT has set the stage to move forward with the goal of <strong>‘Serving Beyond Boundaries’</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Serving Beyond Boundaries</strong> is a cornerstone of our Club’s principles, inspiring our members to transcend geographical, cultural, and social limitations in their pursuit of service to the community. RAC APIIT put forward this theme with a vision to break down barriers and make a positive impact both locally and globally.</p>
              <p>Through this theme, we encourage our Rotaractors to engage in cross-cultural collaborations, learn and understand different perspectives, challenge the stigma and biases prevalent in our community, and develop a deeper appreciation for the diversity of human experiences.</p>
              <p>With the mission of <strong>Serving Beyond Boundaries</strong>, the Rotaract Club of APIIT is dedicated to breaking barriers, fostering understanding, and creating lasting positive change in the lives of others and in the world.</p>
